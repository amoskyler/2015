# TDD: The Hard Parts

Slides: http://nicktomlin.github.io/tdd-the-hard-parts/

Everyone acknowledges that testing is a good thing, but not everyone does it (or does it well). It can be especially difficult to translate the philosophy of test-driven development into a productive front-end workflow. If writing tests for front-end code seems like a chore or you are interested in improving the quality of your front-end testing, this talk is for you. After a brief introduction to the core philosophies of Test Driven Development in a front-end context, we'll explore a TDD workflow by adding a feature to a front-end application. At each step, we'll examine tips and tricks for writing meaningful tests, as well the hardships and pitfalls that arise in any test driven flow. We'll leave the session confident in what we've built and prepared for whatever surprises lie ahead.
