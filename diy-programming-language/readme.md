# DIY Programming Languages

by [Nick Heiner](https://twitter.com/nickheiner)

> Are you tired of programming in JS? Are you pining to work in a locally-sourced, small-batch, micro-craft-brewed language? Do you have big ideas for the next great language that ushers in a new era of productivity? Or do you just want a DSL to solve your specific problem? I'm here to help. I'll explain how programming languages are transformed from text you edit to instructions that a computer can execute. I'll introduce tools you can use to take advantage of this pipeline, and we'll work through a simple example of a small language that compiles to JS. By the end of this talk, you'll be ready to start making your artisanal programming language dreams come true!
